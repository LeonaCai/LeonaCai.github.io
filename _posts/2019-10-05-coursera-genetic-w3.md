# Single Gene Variation
## Origin of Genetic Variation - Mutations as the origin of Genetic Variation
1. what is a mutation?
    - Error in replication/ meiosis leading to a change in a base
2. Mutations do not happen preferentially "when we needthem", they happen **randomly**.    
3. Many mutations are **"bad"**, but rarely(though it happens), a mutation is **"good"**.
4. Some mutations **"do not matter"**, like "GCT" and "GCC" are tanslated to Alanine.
5. Is itmore important that this mutation is passed on by meiosis or mitosis?
    - Meiosis, because it will get pass down to offspring
    
## Shortcomings of the Single Gene Model - Sources of Genetic Variation: Why the simple single gene/2 allele model is insufficient
1. More than one gene controls trait
 - True for almost every phrnotype
2. Variable "penetrance"
    - Mutant froms may "sometimes" affect phenotype but now always do so.
    - BRCA1 breast cancer susceptility, buts BRCA1 breast cancer phenotype is not fullt penetrant- you **CAN** be "bb" and still have all non-cancerous cells in breast.
        - BB or Bb is 12% risk of breast cancer
        - bb is 60% risk
3. Interaction among genes: "epistasis"
    - Effect of genotype at one gene modifies effects of genotype at another gene.
    - Pea flower color: C gene's protein, C protein, is upstream of the P gene's protein - P protein. If there is pp the flower is white, on the other hand, Px is the pink flower. ![There is the pathway](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonaCai/LeonaCai.github.io/master/img/Introduction%20to%20Genetics%20and%20Evolution-week4-1.jpg)
4.  THere can be >2 alleles at a locus!
    - ABO blood types
        - Blood genetypes: AA, AO, BO, AB, OO
        - Blood phenotypes: A, B, AB, and O
5. Environment, and interactions with it.
    - We will begin "heritability" soon.
    - Sun tanning.
        - In absence of sun, do not tan(Environmental effect).
        - Some people naturally taneasier than others(Interaction of environment with genetics)

# Mutations and Complex Traits
## Mutations Rates - Mutation "Rates": How often do mutations happen?
1. Mutations "rate" per generation
- Depends on type of mutation
    - Specific base to specific base (A->G)
    - Specific base to "any different" base (A-> nonA)
    - Other types(inversions, translocations, deletions)
    - Anythins in a gene that tields a phenotype
    - There is the show, if the worm mutation rate to human, how many base mutations do human have? and the ans is 65 new mutations
    -![There is the show, if the worm mutation rate to human, how many base mutations do human have? and the ans is 65 new mutations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonaCai/LeonaCai.github.io/master/img/Introduction%20to%20Genetics%20and%20Evolution-week4-2.jpg)
- Mutations introduce **a lot of** variation into populations

## Mapping Complex Traits - Principles of mapping complex traits
- Most variable traits people study are conteolled by many genes
    - Fruit size
    - Human height
    - Bristle numbers in Drosophila
    - Many diseases
        - Cancers
        - Diabetes
        - Schizophrenia
- QTLs
- ![QTLs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonaCai/LeonaCai.github.io/master/img/Introduction%20to%20Genetics%20and%20Evolution-week4-3.jpg)
- Association of marker genotype with phenotype
    - Markers near ("linked to") gene(s) causing different phenotypes will show an association with that phenotype
    - If there are many genes, and/ or if the effect is "complicated", the assocation may **not be very strong**.

## Complex Traits in Crosses
