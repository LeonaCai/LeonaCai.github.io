## Research Experience
#### ‚Ä¢ Feng Zhang Lab of the State Key Laboratory of Genetic Enineering of School of Life Science of Fudan University, China
<p align="right">2015/4-2019/2</p>
- Bioinformatics
    - Called, analyzed and annotated single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from whole exome sequence samples that change variant interpretation compared to individual variants.
    - Developed an easy and brief way to analyze the trio whole exome sequence;
    - Called, analyzed the differential expression in RNA-Seq data, and drew enrichment plot to make the differences clearly using KEGG or GO as background;
    - Analyzed the results from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).
- Wet experiment
    - Made the libraries of whole exome sequence from the patient's whole blood;
    - Made the comparative genomic hybridization array (aCGH) from the patient's whole blood or patient's carcinoma and adjacent tissue.
- Clinic
    - Collecting POF (primary ovarian failure) patients' whole samples and ranked the priority of these samples with doctor and other members of POF project.
